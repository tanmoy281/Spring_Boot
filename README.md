~~Before building the projects, install sqljdbc jar file into local maven repository, as this artifact is not available in maven central repositories.~~

~~download sqljdbc4-4.0.jar from microsoft website. go to the directory where this jar is downloaded and open cmd. now run the below command:~~


~~mvn install:install-file -Dfile=sqljdbc4-4.0.jar -DgroupId=com.micosoft.sqlserver -DartifactId=sqljdbc4 -Dversion=4.0 -Dpackaging=jar~~

sqljdbc jar is now available in maven central repository, so no need to install it into local maven repository manuallly.
